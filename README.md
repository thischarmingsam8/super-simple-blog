# super-simple-blog
A blog for posting, categorising and sharing. and that's it. (Almost) no setup needed.

Lots still to do before this can be used:

Installation screen
DB Creation
Category handling
User prefs from db
User creation / handling in admin
Theming of CSS
clean up SASS files

at the moment all data is coming from usersettings.inc.php, which you need to create using the sample file included.
